# Intro to Frontend Development

During this course we will learn the basics of Frontend Development, focusing in the three main technologies that support Frontend Development, **HTML**, **CSS** and **Javascript**, as well as some tools built on top of these technologies that allow us to build better and faster apps.
We will also learn some basics about **UX** so we can make apps that are easier to use and understand by the users of our app.

## Frontend Technologies

### HTML

**HTML** (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation ([CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)) or functionality/behavior ([JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)).

### CSS

**CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML "HyperText Markup Language"). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen.

### Javascript

**JS** (JavaScript) is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games, in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation, etc.

## Useful Resources

### W3 Schools

[**W3 Schools**](https://www.w3schools.com/) provides a lot of useful introductory resources to web concepts and functionalities provided by **HTML**, **CSS** and **JS**. It offers a lot of tutorials on how to do specific things in a web page with examples and exercises so we can practice and consolidate what we are learning during this course.

### Stack Overflow

[**Stack Overflow**](http://stackoverflow.com/) is the biggest development related forum in the web. It is vastly used in the software development world to look for information. From very advanced topics to beginner snippets of code (little pieces of code that can be reused), it is a very useful source of information to learn and consolidate all the topics we are going to learn during this course.
**Please, avoid copying and pasting code directly from any web, understand it first and then adapt it to what you need.**

### MDN Web Docs

[**MDN Web Docs** (Mozilla Developer Network Web Docs)](https://developer.mozilla.org/) offers a complete documentation of all the different functionalities provided by **HTML**, **CSS** and **JS**. It's the most complete and accurate resource of all resources described in this section, although is also the most technical and advanced one. Very useful if we want to dive a bit deeper into advanced concepts or getting to know the internals of what we are learning.
