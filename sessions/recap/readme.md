# Mid course recap

So far in the course we have learnt the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript. In the last sessions we are going to focus on modern web development using React, so it is important that we are able to use the knowledge from the first part of the course. Here you can find some resources and exercises to practice and consolidate what you have learnt so far.

## HTML
### Code Academy
[Learn Html](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html). This small course from Code Academy covers the basics of HTML. We have not seen during the course the modules for tables (we will cover this in the react part) and semantic HTML (we will not cover it during this course) so you can skip them.
