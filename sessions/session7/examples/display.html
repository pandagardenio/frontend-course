        <div class="container-block--default">
            As you already know, <strong>divs</strong> are the block elements by default.
        </div>
        <div class="container-block--default">
            As we can see, when an element has <strong>display: block;</strong> elements do not start a new line.
        </div>
        <div class="container-block--default container-block--box-properties">
            As we can see, when an element has <strong>display: block;</strong> margins, padding, width and height are correctly applied.
        </div>
        <span class="container-block container-block--default container-block--box-properties">
            As you already know, we can assign <strong>display: block;</strong> to any element. In this case to a <strong>span</strong>.
        </span>
        <div class="container-block--default">
            <span class="container-inline--default">
                As you already know, <strong>spans</strong> are inline elements by default.
            </span>
            <span class="container-inline--default">
                As we can seee, when an element has <strong>display: inline;</strong> it does not start a new line.
            </span>
            <span class="container-inline--default">
                As we can see, when an element has <strong>display: inline;</strong> margins are correctly applied, but padding is applied in an incorrect way and widht and height is completely ignored.
            </span>
        </div>
        <p>
            As we can see here, elements with <strong>display: inline;</strong> is very useful to <span class="green-text">give styles</span> inside <span class="red-text">text for example</span>.
        </p>
        <div class="container-block--default">
            <span class="container-inline-block">
                However, when we apply <strong>display: inline-block;</strong> we can see that margins, padding, width and height are correctly applied.
            </span>
            <span class="container-inline-block">
                As we can seee, when an element has <strong>display: inline-block</strong> it does not start a new line.
            </span>
